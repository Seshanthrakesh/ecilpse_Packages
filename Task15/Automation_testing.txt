Explain difference between seleniumIDE,SeleniumWebDriver and SeleniumGrid?
ANS: Selenium IDE allows us to record, playback the recording, edit, and debug our test. Selenium WebDriver is an API that executes our test by driving a browser for
 automating an Application Under Test (AUT). Selenium Grid executes our test across multiple browsers, operating systems, and machines.

 3.what is selenium,how it is helpful in Automation Testing ?
 Selenium is an open-source, automated testing tool used to test web applications across various browsers. Selenium can only test web applications, unfortunately,
  so desktop and mobile application can't be tested. However, other tools like Appium and HP's QTP can be used to test software and mobile applications.
  
 4.What all Browser driver are used in Selenium?
 It supports a number of browsers (Google Chrome 12+, Internet Explorer 7,8,9,10, Safari 5.1+, Opera 11.5, Firefox 3+) and operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux/Unix). Selenium also provides compatibility with different programming languages â€“ C#, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, 
 Python, PHP.
 
 5.What are steps to create Simple Webdriver script?Explain with code
 
 Basic Steps in a Selenium WebDriver Script:
 
Step 1Create a WebDriver instance.
Step 2: Navigate to a webpage.
Step 3: Locate a web element on the webpage via locators in selenium.
Step 4: Perform one or more user actions on the element.
Step 5: Preload the expected output/browser response to the action.
Step 6 : Run test.
Step 7: Record results and compare results from them to the expected output.
